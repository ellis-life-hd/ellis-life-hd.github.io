				<div class="research-details">
					In medical imaging, and the classification of either cell types or diseases, there is
					no ground truth, and labelling data are sparse. This is a unique challenge in biological

				<div class="research-details">
					The ability to deploy AI to relevant problems is linked to the volume of data that can be
