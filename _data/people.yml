    **Previous and current research**

    Machine learning is advancing the state of the art in image analysis more rapidly than ever before:
    for many problems in natural image analysis, automated methods are now approaching parity with humans.
    One of the major advantages of learning-based approaches is their general applicability: tailoring to
    a particular problem is performed by providing suitable training data, while the core of the algorithm
    remains unchanged. To bring these methods to members of the life science community without computer
    vision expertise, we have developed a toolkit for interactive learning and segmentation (ilastik).

    While the algorithms in ilastik generalise to provide user-friendly solutions to a wide array of
    image analysis problems, the most challenging bioimage datasets require a tailored approach. Our group
    is particularly interested in solving challenging segmentation problems for light or electron microscopy
    (LM or EM), in 3D and at large scale. Most recently, we have developed methods and tools to segment all
    cells and nuclei in a juvenile worm of the species Platynereis dumerilii (EM, Vergara et al., bioRxiv
    2020), as well as in various plant organs and tissues (LM, Wolny, Cerrone et al., eLife 2020).

    **Future projects and goals**

    All machine learning algorithms require user guidance at the training stage, but deep learning – the
    driver of the current computer vision revolution – is even more annotation hungry. This problem is
    especially acute in biological imaging, where annotation of ground-truth data cannot easily be outsourced
    to non-experts, and changes in experimental conditions can require retraining. Besides the annotation burden,
    the training process itself depends upon non-trivial expertise in the choice and tuning of hyperparameters.
    Our group is currently working on methods and training strategies that would reduce the requirements on the
    amount of training data, which we hope to incorporate into ilastik. We are also interested in creative
    combinations of deep learning and microscopy (Wagner, Beuttenmuelluer et al., bioRxiv 2020) and learning-based
    analysis of morphology.

    **Visual Synthesis and Interpretable AI with Disentangled Representations**

    Deep learning has significantly improved the expressiveness of representations. However, present research
    still fails to understand why and how they work and cannot reliably predict when they fail. Moreover, the
    different characteristics of our physical world are commonly intermingled, making it impossible to study them
    individually. We incorporate novel paradigms for disentangling multiple object characteristics and present
    interpretable models to translate arbitrary network representations into semantically meaningful, interpretable
    concepts. We also obtain disentangled generative models that explain their latent representations by synthesis
    while being able to alter different object characteristics individually. 

    **Deep Metric and Representation Learning**

    To understand visual content, computers need to learn what makes images similar. This similarity learning
    directly implies a representation of the visual content that captures the inherent structure of the data. We
    present several approaches that can be applied on top of arbitrary deep metric learning methods and various
    network architectures. Key issues that these works tackle include improving generalization and transfer to novel
    data, shared feature learning, and adaptive sampling strategies based on reinforcement learning to effectively
    utilize large amounts of training data.

    Hi!

    I develop machine learning algorithms for image analysis. More specifically, I am interested in principled methods
    that ingest images or video, and output "structured" predictions, such as the partitioning of an image into its
    constituent parts, or the tracking of all objects in a video. Most of our applications are in the life sciences;
    for instance, we try and segment all cells in a brain or a plant, or track virus components before assembly.

    My focus is on methods that have a sound mathematical background, such as combinatorial optimization or algebraic
    graph theory, while being widely applicable and useful in practice. I attach particular importance to methods that
    can be trained with few examples, or by weak supervision, to empower colleagues from other disciplines to analyze
    their own data, conveniently. To the same end, I have launched the ilastik program for interactive machine learning
    (paper) that is now headed by Anna Kreshuk.

    I enjoy, and feel most privileged, to be able to work on things unknown, and to teach the next generation of
    scientists and engineers.

    I am proud that several past PhD students continue to serve in research and education, including

      - Anna Kreshuk, Group Leader at EMBL
      - Bjoern Andres, Professor at TU Dresden
      - Bjoern Menze, Professor at Zurich University
      - Bernhard Renard, Professor at HPI, Potsdam Universty

    Luckily, I am blessed with a fantastic lab whose members happen to be both extremely gifted and nice.

    The mission of the division of Computer Assisted Medical Interventions is to improve the quality of interventional
    healthcare in a data-driven manner. To this end, the multidisciplinary group builds upon principles and knowledge
    from a diversity of research fields including artificial intelligence (AI), statistics, computer vision, biophotonics
    and medicine. **Surgical Data Science**, the scientific discipline of enhancing interventional healthcare through
    capturing, organization, analysis and modeling of data, constitutes the first and central pillar of our research.
    Committed to the ultimate goal of creating benefit for patients, medical staff and other stakeholders, we place a
    particular focus on addressing common roadblocks to clinical translation of surgical data science methods such as
    data sparsity or questions of uncertainty handling. A second pillar is our research in **novel interventional imaging
    techniques** enabled by deep learning.  We are particularly interested in developing spectral imaging devices into safe
    and reliable real-time tissue imaging and navigation modalities during interventions. This is achieved with physics-based
    machine learning concepts that leverage prior knowledge in the form of physical simulations. The division’s profile
    is complemented by research on the cross-cutting topic of the reliable **validation of AI algorithms**.

    **End-to-end Deep Learning Architectures**

    Current Medical Image Analysis approaches often comprise a set of separate processing steps such as Registration,
    Normalization, Segmentation, Feature Extraction and Classification. This project develops techniques for the integration
    of these components into one end-to-end deep learning architecture. This enables simultaneous optimization of all component
    w.r.t the ultimate clinical task (e.g. disease classification). 

    **Machine Learning-based dMRI Processing**

    This project deals with processing, analysis and visualization of neurological datasets with focus on diffusion-weighted
    magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI). Major fields of research are the development and implementation of new methods for
    segmentation or tractography of white matter tracts, as well as tissue segmentation and modelling. Besides the classical
    methods that are used in this field, we explore the application of machine learning in the context of diffusion-weighted
    image processing.

    **Validation of Fiber Tractography**

    The quantitative evaluation of fiber tractography is a long-standing challenge for the field that represents an essential
    prerequisite for widespread application and meaningful interpretation of the approach. In this project we develop
    phantom-based as well as in-vivo methods to approach this challenge and validate tractography results in large-scale
    evaluation studies and international challenges.

    Ullrich Köthe heads the “Explainable Machine Learning” group at the Interdisciplinary Center for Scientific Computing (IWR).
    His research focuses on deep learning methodology that strives to establish machine learning as a new way to gain insight
    and create new knowledge in the sciences. Models that merely make somewhat accurate predictions in a blackbox manner are
    not good enough for this goal. He and his group thus investigate the design and theoretical foundations of novel network
    architectures and training algorithms, which provide reliable self-assessment of their uncertainty, emerge humanly
    interpretable latent representations and are robust against distribution shifts in the data. In particular, they utilise
    invertible neural networks as an especially promising approach to the efficient and well-founded probabilistic treatment
    of inverse problems and generative modeling. They demonstrated the utility of these solutions in numerous applications
    from physics and astronomy to computer vision, biology, and medicine. To achieve its goals, the group puts high emphasis
    on interdisciplinary work with other fields of science, and on the rapid dissemination of its results via reusable
    open-source software libraries.

    A central challenge of biomedicine is to understand how the biological systems that underlie healthy life and disease
    react to variations in their makeup (genetic variation, for example) or their environment (drugs, for example). Our
    group brings together researchers from quantitative disciplines – mathematics, statistics, physics and computer science
    – and from different fields of biology and medicine.

    We employ statistics and machine learning to discover patterns in large datasets, understand mechanisms, and act upon
    predictive and causal relationships to, ultimately, address questions in personal genomics and molecular medicine. More
    specifically, we use large-scale data acquisition and quantitative modelling of phenotypes and molecular profiles,
    systematic perturbations (such as drugs or high-throughput genetics) and computational analysis of non-linear, epistatic
    interaction networks.

    Genomics and other molecular profiling technologies have resulted in increasingly detailed biology-based understanding
    of human disease. The next challenge is using this knowledge to engineer treatments and cures. We integrate observational
    data, for example from large-scale sequencing and molecular profiling, with interventional data – systematic genetic or
    chemical screens – to reconstruct a fuller picture of the underlying causal relationships and actionable intervention
    points. A fascinating example is our work on genotype-specific vulnerability and resistance of tumours to targeted drugs
    in our precision oncology project.

    As we engage with new data types, our aim is to develop high-quality computational and statistical methods of wide
    applicability. We consider the release and maintenance of scientific software an integral part of scientific publishing,
    and we contribute to the Bioconductor Project, an open source software collaboration to provide tools for the analysis
    and study of high-throughput genomic data. An example is our DESeq2 package for analysing count data from high-throughput
    sequencing.

    **Future projects and goals**

    We aim to develop the computational techniques needed to analyse exciting biological data types:

     - Clinical multi-omics: we work with clinical researchers to develop predictive assays and algorithms.
     - Many powerful mathematical ideas exist but are difficult to access. We translate them into practical methods and
       software that make a real difference to biomedical researchers, an approach we term ‘translational statistics’.
     - Quantitative proteomics and in vivo drug-target mapping.
     - Single-cell and single-molecule omics.
     - High-throughput multidimensional phenotyping: mapping gene-gene and gene-drug interactions through computational
       image analysis of cell and tissue microscopy, machine learning and mathematical modelling.

    The saezlab develops and applies methods to integrate large-scale molecular (‘Omics’) data with mechanistic molecular
    knowledge into statistical and machine learning methods, and share these tools as free open-source packages. The goal
    is to acquire a functional understanding of the deregulation of cellular processes in disease and to apply this knowledge
    to develop novel therapeutics. A major emphasis is to build context-specific models that are both mechanistic (to provide
    understanding) and predictive (to generate novel hypotheses). To build these models, we combine existing biochemical
    knowledge with different types of large scale data, including proteomic, transcriptomic and metabolomic data, also at
    the single-cell and spatially resolved level. We believe that this biological knowledge can be instrumental to move from
    pure correlation to causation in large data sets, and thereby identify the molecular processes that underlie specific
    phenomena.

    **The Korbel group combines computational and experimental approaches, including in single cells, to unravel determinants
    and consequences of germline and somatic genetic variation with a special focus on disease mechanisms.**

    Genetic variation studies have uncovered that genomic structural variants (SVs) such as deletions, insertions, and
    inversions account for most varying bases in human genomes. Recent studies indicate that somatic SVs occur post-zygotically
    throughout our lifespan, and show association with ageing and human diseases - calling into question the long-held belief
    that the genome is largely static within an individual, and preserved across all cells therein.

    We employ a diversity of omics and imaging approaches - from single-cell multi-omics to spatial and bulk-cell omics as
    well as state-of-the-art microscopy - to investigate molecular mechanisms behind complex human phenotypes associated
    with genetic variants.

    In addition to experimental methodologies applied to tissues and organoids, our laboratory is devising data science
    techniques including state-of-the-art machine learning methods for processing high-dimensional single-cell data sets,
    and for coupling genetic variation discovery with molecular and clinical phenotype data.

    **Previous and current research**

    Of particular interest is understanding patterns of genetic mosaicism at cellular resolution. Our scTRIP method
    (Sanders et al., Nat Biotechnol 2020, Fig. 1) enables the direct detection of SV mutational processes in single cells,
    and as such can be used to obtain insights into pathomechanisms acting in human tissues.

    Another interest centres around uncovering commonalities and differences between molecular disease mechanisms in disparate
    cancer entities. In a rare-variant association study in medulloblastoma (MB) genomes/exomes, we recently described rare
    germline loss-of-function variants in the Elongator complex protein 1 (ELP1) gene in 15% of childhood MB genomes driven
    by Sonic hedgehog signalling (Waszak et al., Nature 2020). ELP1-associated MBs exhibit somatic loss of the wild-type ELP1
    allele mediated by somatic large deletions that concomitantly cause loss of the PTCH1 gene residing adjacent to ELP1 on
    chromosome 9, involving an intriguing ‘three-hit’ molecular process (Fig. 2).

    With respect to data science, our group has pioneered the utilisation of cloud computing to enable the global sharing and
    processing of large-scale biological data. We co-initiated and co-led the ICGC/TCGA Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes
    (PCAWG) project, an international study for sharing cancer genomes. Our group is also actively involved in building the
    German Human Genome-Phenome Archive (GHGA), a national research data infrastructure for disseminating and federating human
    genomics data from German studies nationally and internationally.
